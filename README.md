# AppCraft Studios - Static Website

This repository contains the code for the AppCraft Studios static website. It's a single-page application built purely with HTML, Tailwind CSS (via CDN), and vanilla JavaScript for navigation.

## Description

AppCraft Studios is presented as a modern, responsive website showcasing services related to mobile and web application development. This implementation uses a single HTML file to simulate a multi-page experience by dynamically showing and hiding content sections based on user navigation (using URL hashes).

## Features

* **Single-Page Application (SPA) Feel:** Uses JavaScript to navigate between Home, Services, and Contact sections without page reloads.
* **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS utility classes.
* **Clean UI:** Modern design aesthetic with gradient buttons and clear typography.
* **Sections:**
    * **Home:** Hero section with a prominent heading, description, and call-to-action buttons.
    * **Services:** Detailed cards outlining various development services offered.
    * **Contact:** Contact form (static demo) and contact information.
    * **Privacy Policy & Terms of Service:** Placeholder pages linked from the footer.
* **Hash-Based Routing:** Uses URL fragments (`#home`, `#services`, etc.) for navigation and bookmarking specific sections.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Structure of the website.
* **Tailwind CSS (v3 via CDN):** Utility-first CSS framework for styling and layout.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** For handling navigation logic (showing/hiding sections) and basic form interaction simulation.
* **Lucide Icons (via CDN/SVG):** For iconography.
* **Google Fonts (Inter):** For typography.
